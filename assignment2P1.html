    <h1>Renes Descartes</h1>
    <p>I find the philospher <strong>Renes Descartes</strong> to have really interesting ideas. <br />
    One of his main philosphys <strong>" I think therefore, I am"</strong>, remains with me ever since I learned about it years ago. <br />
    Some movies have taken inspirations from his ideas too, like the Matrix. Descartes philosphy of being a entity inside a simulation ran by a higher power can be easily seen in the Matrix series. <br />
    To read more about Descartes, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes'> here</a> is a wiki link. If Descartes was not of your liking, <br /> 
    but you still wanna read about philosphers, then you can head to the philosphers<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_philosophers'> wiki list.</a></p>
